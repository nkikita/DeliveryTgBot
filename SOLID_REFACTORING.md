# SOLID Principles Applied to DeliveryTgBot

This document explains how SOLID principles have been applied to refactor the Telegram bot code.

## Overview

The original `BotHandler` class was violating several SOLID principles by handling too many responsibilities. The refactoring separates concerns and creates a more maintainable, extensible architecture.

## SOLID Principles Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Before**: The `BotHandler` class was responsible for:
- Handling all types of updates (messages, callbacks)
- Processing commands
- Managing order state
- Building keyboards
- Handling address queries
- Managing user sessions

**After**: Responsibilities are now separated into specialized classes:
- `BotHandler`: Orchestrates the handling of updates
- `MessageProcessor`: Processes text messages and manages order flow
- `OrderStateManager`: Manages order state transitions and business logic
- `StartCommandHandler`, `ResetCommandHandler`: Handle specific commands
- `CityCallbackHandler`, `DriverCallbackHandler`: Handle specific callback types

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Before**: Adding new commands or callback types required modifying the main handler class.

**After**: The system is open for extension but closed for modification:
- New commands can be added by implementing `ICommandHandler`
- New callback types can be added by implementing `ICallbackHandler`
- New order state logic can be added by extending `OrderStateManager`

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Before**: Some interfaces were too broad and implementations could behave unexpectedly.

**After**: Each interface has a clear, focused contract:
- `ICommandHandler`: Single method for handling commands
- `ICallbackHandler`: Single method for handling callbacks
- `IOrderStateManager`: Clear methods for order state management

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Before**: Some interfaces had methods that weren't always needed.

**After**: Interfaces are focused and specific:
- `ICommandHandler`: Only command-related methods
- `ICallbackHandler`: Only callback-related methods
- `IOrderStateManager`: Only order state management methods

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Before**: High-level modules depended on concrete implementations.

**After**: High-level modules depend on abstractions:
- `BotHandler` depends on `ICommandHandler[]` and `ICallbackHandler[]`
- `MessageProcessor` depends on `IOrderStateManager`
- All services are injected through interfaces

## New Architecture Components

### Command Handlers
- `StartCommandHandler`: Handles `/start` command
- `ResetCommandHandler`: Handles `/reset` command

### Callback Handlers
- `CityCallbackHandler`: Handles city selection callbacks
- `DriverCallbackHandler`: Handles driver selection callbacks

### Services
- `OrderStateManager`: Manages order state transitions
- `MessageProcessor`: Processes text messages and manages flow
- `ConfigurationService`: Centralizes configuration management
- `TelegramServiceFactory`: Creates Telegram service instances

### Dependency Injection
- Uses Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- All services are properly registered and injected
- Configuration is centralized and injectable

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Each class has a single, clear responsibility
2. **Testability**: Dependencies can be easily mocked for unit testing
3. **Extensibility**: New features can be added without modifying existing code
4. **Readability**: Code is easier to understand and navigate
5. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts
6. **Configuration**: API keys and connection strings are centralized

## Adding New Features

### Adding a New Command
1. Implement `ICommandHandler`
2. Register in `Program.cs`
3. The system automatically picks it up

### Adding a New Callback Type
1. Implement `ICallbackHandler`
2. Register in `Program.cs`
3. Add handling logic in `BotHandler.HandleCallbackQueryAsync`

### Adding New Order State Logic
1. Extend `OrderStateManager` methods
2. Add new validation or business logic
3. Update prompts and state transitions

## Configuration

The `ConfigurationService` centralizes all configuration values:
- Telegram bot token
- Yandex API key
- Database connection string

In production, these should come from environment variables or secure configuration files.

## Error Handling

The refactored code includes proper error handling:
- Try-catch blocks in the main handler
- Graceful degradation for failed operations
- Logging of errors for debugging

## Future Improvements

1. **Logging**: Implement proper logging framework (Serilog, NLog)
2. **Validation**: Add input validation and sanitization
3. **Caching**: Implement proper caching strategies
4. **Monitoring**: Add health checks and metrics
5. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
